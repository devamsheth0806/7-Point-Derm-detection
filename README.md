# Derm7Pt

This project is to identify the lesions and their 7-point checklist, that is its characteristics, using Machine Learning as well as Deep learning algorithms.

At the time when project was being developed, only machine learning algorithms are implemented, which didn't gave an accuracy above 63%. 

Dataset used is from the below mentioned link:

Setup of the environment and tools required:
1. Get this repo by either downloading or using Git Desktop
2. Get the dataset from the above mentioned link. You will need to request for the dataset. They will send the dataset link to your mail box.
3. Extract the dataset into a folder named images.
4. Anaconda navigator to run these Jupyter notebook files is required because it contains few libraries.
5. Also need to install Tensforflow library for feature extraction and deep learning.
